                      I have had an interest in IT since I was a young boy, learning simple javascript programming from the age of 8 and throughout my years have developed more and more complex knowledge on programming languages 
                      and how they work. I studied Computer Science at GCSE and this was a more in depth look and languages like 
                      HTML and Python, this was another eye-opening experence as I had never explored these languages. I learnt 
                      how to make a program work and how to adapt and change it to my will, giving me more creative freedom.<br>
                      <br>
                      When it comes to photography, it began when I was using my mobile phone in the 2020 Lockdown, my 
                      school hosted a competition on who could take the best photo and I entered, this opening my eyes to 
                      the joy of taking photos and over time this grew into a passion. My first camera was a PRAKTICA SLR and 
                      this was a family camera that was my Great Grandfather. I applied for my A Level course and this was where 
                      my journey began. I got a Canon EOS 2000D for christmas and ive been developing my skills since.
